# Simple Calculator

A clean, modern, and functional web-based calculator created using fundamental web technologies. This project demonstrates a responsive user interface and robust calculation logic without relying on unsafe functions like `eval()`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the calculation logic and user interaction.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Decimal Support:** Handles floating-point numbers correctly.
- **Sequential Operations:** Correctly processes chained calculations (e.g., `5 + 3 * 2`).
- **Clear Function:** A 'C' button to reset the entire calculator state.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
- **Modern UI:** A clean and intuitive interface with interactive feedback on button presses.
- **Error Handling:** Includes a user-friendly alert for division by zero.

## Setup Instructions

3.  **Open the application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. No special servers or dependencies are required.

## AI Support Explanation

This project was developed with the assistance of an AI coding partner (Gemini Code Assist). The AI's contributions were crucial in elevating the project from a basic prototype to a polished application.

Key contributions include:

- **Code Review & Refactoring:** Analyzing the initial code and suggesting significant improvements for quality, clarity, and security.
- **HTML Enhancement:** Recommending changes to improve semantic structure and accessibility, such as adding `aria-label` attributes and separating JavaScript event handlers from the markup.
- **CSS Modernization:** Providing a completely new stylesheet to give the calculator a modern, clean, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript Logic Overhaul:** Rewriting the core JavaScript logic to remove the insecure `eval()` function, implement a more robust state-based calculation model, and fix bugs related to sequential operations.
- **Documentation:** Generating this `README.md` file to clearly explain the project's features, setup, and development process.

This collaboration demonstrates how AI can be a powerful tool for accelerating development, improving code quality, and implementing best practices.
